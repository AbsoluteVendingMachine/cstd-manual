        <p>This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.</p>
        <p>This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:</p>

        <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p>SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007</p>
        <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
        
        <p>PREAMBLE</p>
        <p>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide</p>
        <p>development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation</p>
        <p>efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and</p>
        <p>open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership</p>
        <p>with others.</p>
        
        <p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and</p>
        <p>redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The</p>
        <p>fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,</p>
        <p>redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved</p>
        <p>names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,</p>
        <p>however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The</p>
        <p>requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply</p>
        <p>to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
        
        <p>DEFINITIONS</p>
        <p>"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright</p>
        <p>Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may</p>
        <p>include source files, build scripts and documentation.</p>
        
        <p>"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the</p>
        <p>copyright statement(s).</p>
        
        <p>"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as</p>
        <p>distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).</p>
            
        <p>"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,</p>
        <p>or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the</p>
        <p>Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a</p>
        <p>new environment.</p>
            
        <p>"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical</p>

        <p>PERMISSION & CONDITIONS</p>
        <p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining</p>
        <p>a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,</p>
        <p>redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font</p>

        <p>2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,</p>
        <p>redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy</p>

        <p>included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or</p>
        <p>in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or</p>
        <p>binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.</p>
        
        <p>3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font</p>
        <p>Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding</p>

        <p>using the Font Software.</p>
        
        <p>TERMINATION</p>
        <p>This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are</p>
        <p>not met.</p>
